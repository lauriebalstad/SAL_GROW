<p><b>Warming world:</b> Southeast Alaska has a mosaic of river types, some are fed by rain and others by glacial melt. Glacial-fed streams tend to reach their maximum temperature sooner, and maintain their high temperatures longer, while rain-fed streams tend to reach warmer temperatures and have stronger seasonality. Additionally, glacial-fed streams tend to have prey availability earlier in the year compared to rain-fed streams. These mulitple river types can benefit Coho salmon, because they can move between rivers to find better temperatures and better food.</p>

<p>In this set of simulations, we preserve the seaonality of the streams as rivers get warmer or colder (for example, rain-fed streams always show a temperature peak in the summer). The amount of prey and prey quality will vary slightly simulation to simulation because of stochasticity, but the maximum amount of prey, general digestibility of prey, and seasonilty of prey is constant throughout the simulations. Salmon move between the streams based on how many of the streams there are and which stream has the best growing conditions -- in other words, if there are lots of rain streams and salmon grow better in rain streams, they will go to the rain stream, and vise versa for glaical streams. The grey line shows the simulation where salmon can move, while the colored lines show the simulations when salmon do not move.</p>

<p><b>Some questions to consider:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Salmon can move to other areas to find more food. Different rivers, like different stores, will have different prey at different times. Why salmon might move between streams, and how does moving between streams impact a salmon's growth? Does movement improve salmon growth? </li>
  <li>There are some cases where the salmon size is 0 grams. Try adjusting the temperature, prey amount and prey quality bars to make this happen. When does this occur? What does it mean, biologically? </li>
  <li>As cliamte change occurs, river temperatures will get warmer. How does increasing the temperatures of both streams change the growth of the fish? How does changing the proportion of glacial-fed rivers affect these results?</li>
  <li>What choices of temperature and glacial proportions maximize salmon growth? Are those choices realistic?</li>
  <li>We make many assumptions in this model that could impact the realism of the results. What would you add to these simulations to make them more realistic?</li>
</ul>
