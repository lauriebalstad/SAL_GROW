<p><b>Warming world:</b> Southeast Alaska has a mosaic of river types, some are feed by rain and others by glacial melt. Glacial-fed streams tend to reach their maximum temperature sooner, and maintain their high temperatures longer, while rain-fed streams tend to reach warmer temperatures and have stronger seasonality. Additionally, glacial-fed streams tend to have prey avalibilty earlier in the year compared to rain-fed streams. These mulitple river types can benefit Coho salmon, because they can move between rivers to find better temperatures and better food.</p>

<p>In this set of simulations, we preserve the seaonality of the streams as temperature changes, but hold the prey amount constant. Salmon move between the streams based on how many of the streams there are and which stream has the best growing conditions -- in other words, if there are lots of rain streams and salmon grow better in rain streams, they will go to the rain stream, and vise versa for glaical streams. The grey line shows the simulation where salmon can move, while the colored lines show the simulations when salmon do not move.</p>

<p><b>Some questions to consider:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>How does moving between streams impact a salmon's growth?</li>
  <li>As cliamte change occurs, river temperatures will get warmer. How does increasing the temperatures of both streams change the growth of the fish? How does changing the proportion of glacial-fed rivers affect these results?</li>
  <li>What choices of temperature and glacial proportions maximize salmon growth? Are those choices realistic?</li>
  <li>We make many assumptions in this model that could impact the realism of the results. What would you add to these simulations to make them more realistic?</li>
</ul>
