<p><b>About:</b> This Shiny app provides three lessons about the effects of temperature and prey on Coho salmon growth. Each simulation is stochastic, so the exact outputs of a simulation are unique, but the qualitative model patterns are convergent (i.e., each person's simulations are different, but each person's interpretation should be similar). The fish growth patterns and formulas come from Fish Bioenergetics 3.0 by by Paul C. Hanson, Timothy B. Johnson, Daniel E. Schindler, and James F. Kitchell, published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Limnology and University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute (1997). The approximate river temperature and prey patterns are loosely based on data from "A melting cryosphere constrains fish growth by synchronizing the seasonal phenology of river food webs" by J. Ryan Bellmore, Jason B. Fellman, Eran Hood, Matthew R. Dunkle, and Richard T. Edwards, published in Global Change Biology (2022; 28:4807â€“4818).</p>
