<p><b>Prey quality:</b> Fish get their energy from eating food, but not everything they eat is edible -- some of their food is non-digestible and some times they eat non-food things (liek small plastics). Make a prediction: Will fish grow more as they eat more food? As more food becomes more non-digestible, will the fish grow more or less? </p>
