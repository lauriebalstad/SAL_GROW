<p><b>Notes for lesson planning:</b> This activity is scalable to many grade levels and can be used in both biology and mathematics classes (with modifications). Here, we give a lesson plan for a biology class.</p>

<p><b>Biology lesson:</b></p>

<p><b>Key biology concepts students will learn:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Animals grow using the energy from the prey they eat
  <li>We can predict how much an animal will grow based off what it eats: prey volume and prey quality both determine growth
  <li>Define terms such as: predator, prey, herbavore, ominivore, carnivore, prey quality, thermal optimum
  <li>Well-defined, well-parameterized models allow us to answer “what if” questions (e.g., what happens to growth if it is warmer than normal or there is lower quality food?)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Opening:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Start by reminding students that juvenile salmon live in freshwater. While in freshwater, salmon need to develop (change their body for outmigration to marine environments) and growth. Both these things take lots of energy. Explain that salmon eating and growing is a lot like us!
  <li>Ask students where they get energy to grow (food). Explain that salmon also get energy from food, and ask what sorts of food salmon might eat. Define food web terms (predator, prey, herbivore, etc.).
  <li>Ask students where they get food (store, local foraging). Explain that salmon can also only eat prey that's in the river with them. Sometimes there's lots of prey and sometimes there's very little prey (like when the barge doesn't come for two weeks in the winter).
  <li>If doing "Warming world:" Show students the figure below of two different kinds of streams (brown, tanin-rich rain-fed stream with blue, silty glacial-fed stream) intersecting in Montana Creek. Explain that just like people, salmon can move to other areas to find more food. Different rivers, like different stores, will have different prey at different times. Ask students why salmon might move between streams, and why this movement might be good or bad for salmon.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Activity 1: Physical activity</b> Tell students they will be salmon, and hide cards with names of other river organisms (list at end of lesson plan) around the classroom. The cards are colored green (salmon can eat) or yellow (salmon cannot eat); do not tell students why the cards are colored. More information on the river insects can be found <a href="https://www.naturebob.com/sites/default/files/AquaticInsects.pdf">in this field guide</a> and more information on the river food web can be found <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eap.1486?saml_referrer">in this journal article, Bellmore and others, 2017, Ecological Applications</a>. Tell the students that salmon have to use their food to breathe (it takes lots of energy to respire!) and then can use remaining energy to grow. Explain that if it is very warm or very cold, it takes more energy to breathe.</p>

<p>Give students ~5 minutes to find as many cards as they can. Students will come back together as a table group and count all the cards they have. Ask the students to talk in small table groups about the cards they found and sort the cards into things they think salmon can eat and things salmon can't eat (the students should sort the cards into yellow and green, help the students think through their choices if you notice mix-ups and ask students why they categorized items differently, e.g., salmon too small to eat, not edible). Have the students count only the cards that the salmon can eat. Ask the students is they think they have enough food to grow.</p>

<p>For "Prey quality": Ask students if they are picky eaters. Tell students that salmon are picky -- they can't everything, and this limits their ability to get food. In addition, tell students that not all parts of prey are digestible. Ask students for an example of this (e.g., prey bones). Tell the students that 20% (1/5) of their food is not digestible and have them recount their cards. Ask the students how they think the amount of prey and the digestibility of prey will influence salmon growth.</p>

<p>For "Temperature and consumption" and "Warming world": Tell students that in a cold river, they need 2 cards to breathe and can use the remaining to grow. Ask the students if they have leftover cards for growth. Ask students to predict if they will grow more or less when it is very hot. Tell students that in a very hot river, they need 4 cards to breathe -- ask if they made the correct prediction. Finally, ask students to predict if they will grow more or less if the river froze. Tell students that in a frozen river, all salmon die. Tell students that salmon have a thermal optimum, or temperature preference. Given what the students have learned, ask students how they think temperature (i.e., climate change) influences salmon growth.</p>

<p><b>Activity 2: Modeling activity</b> Tell students that they have just done a mathematical simulation of salmon growth! The simulations can get much more complex, so we can use computers to help us do the underlying math. We can model salmon growth using equations that account for the temperature, prey amount, and prey digestibility:</p>

<p><i>Growth = Consumption - Respiration(temperature) - Waste(non-digestible)</i></p>

<p>where consumption is the prey amount around, respiration is the energy used to breathe (scaled by temperature), and waste is the food salmon can't digest. The energy which remains after respiration which is digestible can be used for growth. Have students open the Shiny app to the correct tab. Explain that this is an approximate simulation for Coho salmon growth in Southeast Alaska rivers, using patterns of temperature and prey availability from real rivers (Bellmore and others, 2022, Global Change Biology). The center graph shows the expected growth trajectory of a Coho salmon (in grams) for a one year period, while the two right graphs show the river conditions (prey amount and river temperature). For all pages, the simulations in green are for a rain-fed river ("Prey quality" and "Temperature and consumption" show only rain-fed rivers). For "Warming world", the simulations in blue are for a glacier-fed rivers, and the simulations in grey allow salmon movement, where salmon will stochastically move between rivers, with a preference to be in the river type with better growing conditions. Ask the students why the river conditions change throughout the year (seasonality/changes with the seasons). Describe the sliders on the left in relation to the above equation. Have students answer the questions at the bottom of the page by moving the sliders and interpreting the graphs. Ask the students to compare their results to the predictions they made at the end of the physical activity.<\p>
