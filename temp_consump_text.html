<p><b>Temperature and consumption:</b> Fish get energy by consuming (eating) food. The energy a fish gets from food is first used for basic functions, like breathing -- even though it feels like it doesn't take much energy to breathe, we also use a lot of the energy from our food to breathe! Next, a fish will use the energy from food to move. Finally, any remaining energy can be used for growth. A fish which consumes more food has more leftover energy avalible after breathing and moving to grow. Temperature can also change the amount of energy a fish has leftover after breathing and moving: as it gets extra warm or extra cold, it takes the fish a lot more energy to breathe and move. </p>

<p><b>Some questions to consider:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>What temperature does the salmon grow best at? Test temperatures that are really warm and really cold!</li>
  <li>What happens as the amount of food increases?</li>
  <li>There are some cases where the salmon size is 0 grams. Try adjusting both the temperature and prey quality bars to make this happen. When does this occur? What does it mean, biologically? </li>
</ul>
