<p><b>Introduction:</b> Why do species migrate? Species might migrate in order to find food or avoid harsh climate. In this simulation, we compare how ease of getting food affects the number of individuals who migrate.</p>

<p><b>Simulation:</b> Individauls get get food, complete their migration (or remain residents), and then must get a nesting site (N). In the simulationsYou can adjust the proability a migrant (M) and a resident (R) gets food with the sliders to the left (probabilities q and p, respectively). Additionally, migrants might die on their migratory routes due to predation (probability r), which can also be adjusted with the slider to the left. The equations are as follows: </p>

<p>R(t+1) = min(N, q*R(t)) + (1-p)*M(t) + p*(1-r)*M(t) + max(p*r*M(t))-N-q*R(t), 0) </p>
<p>M(t+1) = min(N-q*R(t), p*r*M(t)) + (1-q)*R(t) + max(q*R(t)-N, 0) </p>

<p>When the simulation runs stochastically, the probabilities are drawn for each time step of the simulation, i.e., q, p, and r change slightly each time step. The plot shows one of the simulations in a dark line, and the four other simulations in light dotted lines to help give a sense outcome variation. </p>

<p><b>Some questions to consider:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>If the probability migrant survives predation is 1, there is no predation. What do you think happens as predation increases? Test it! Increase the amount of predation (decrease survival). </li>
  <li>How does changing the number of nests affect the outcomes (and what real life things might cause the number of nests to change)? When do outcomes look stable (go to particular values) and when do the number of residents and migrants change? Why might this be?</li>
  <li>What other things would be important to consider? How might you add them to the game?</li>
</ul>
